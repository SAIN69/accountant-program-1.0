This is a project I made back in highschool. We were tasked to make an accountatn program using java.

Pros of the program:
- It works as intended
- Delivers correct values (sometimes)
- Easy to navigate
- Easy to use
- Minimal data entry for simplicity

Cons of the program:
- Can be rewritten and fixed
- The interface can be upgraded and beautyfied
